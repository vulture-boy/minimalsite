          <p>
            how much do you know about me?<br>
            how much is apparent when we're in public?<br>
            maybe I've been wearing Nite-Glo vest without realizing it. <br>
            i find myself witholding the things that should bring me joy, a demon wanting to be seen in its true form. what ends up becoming apparent are half-truths; half of what I am, half of what I should be, a translucent picture of where I am and where I want to be.<br>
            but what is it that you desire? what part of me do you want to see? what shape would bring me closer to you?<br>
            come downstairs, let me in; I'm sure the security office has room for two. i'll bring some bagels and a USB. We can broadcast to the video screens, play our favourite shows and scream when we crack a joke.<br>
            Truth be told, I just want to forget about the real world. I want to be vulnerable around you. These thoughts alone could impair the security of this institution we've built for ourselves...<br>
            but I still hope you feel this way too.<br>
            <br>
            (The intercom acknowledges the request but the gates remain locked. I begin making my way home, alone but seen.<br> 
            For the time being, that may just be enough.)<br>
