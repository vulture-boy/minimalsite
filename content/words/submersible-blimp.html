          <strong>submersible blimp</strong><br>
          <hr>
          
          <p>
            my 'class' boarded a blimp that was parked in the harbor.<br>
            the professor joined me in my cabin and we looked out the window at chicago during a cloudy day.<br>
            the blimp then started to drive down the road and onto the highway, continuting to accelerate.<br>
            we passed by some large black and white panelled structures with antennae that rose diagonally towards the water, then took a left and started driving up a steep hill.<br>
            I was in the cockpit now (how?) and apparently my dad was driving and I asked him "Where did you learn how to drive a blimp??" and he just kept muttering under his breath "Yasha... Yasha...".<br> 
            Anyways, the blimp apparently took off from the precipice of this steep hill between skyscrapers, wobbled for a moment and then was successfully in flight in the air.<br>
            I think I had it in my mind that this was a submarine instead of a blimp so I was thoroughly confused until I figured out blimps were in fact airborne flight vehicles...<br>
            I was also thoroughly distracted by all the things I wanted to photograph.<br>
            It then occurred to me that you don't drive a damn blimp down a runway with that air resistance, and that broke the immersion so much that I woke up.<br>
