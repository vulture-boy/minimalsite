          <strong>my hands, in the clay</strong><br>
          <hr>
          
            <p>
                At the water's edge I look down and see a familiar stream of koi.<br>
Thirteen metres below the surface lies the basin: years of sediment nurturing aquatic flora.<br>
I dream of swimming among them as I scatter dimes, crashing upon the rocks and breaking their sails.<br>
Do they hear my wishes? They linger at the surface. A fondness. Perhaps if I were to breach the miniscus... they surely would scatter. (would they not?)<br>
<br>
The pool glitters. I envy the way it shines... the light flickering from the cast nickel. My wealth for my dreams and desires; this part of me is now a part of the pond.<br>
<br>
The surface stills and I see her face.<br>
Do I chase my desires, will I drown? Having looked so deeply I can no longer tell if the surface is a reflection or a transparent medium. I slowly dip my hands as to not break the spell and wrap them gently, cradling the neck. My sandals saturate as we shift our mass and pull ashore, the bones but reeds caught within the fluid. She wakes from the dream elsewhere, but is this where she wants to be, so devoid of dimes? I jest to mask my anxiety. The warmth drains on from my skin as we embrace, a softness that takes. But she is but mud and thereafter recedes with the tide.<br>
Realizing my error, I motion to turn about, my garments spoiled with soil and loam. She looks upon the fool wading for dreams never really there, but she offers her hand nevertheless and help me on my feet to dry. We walk along the dock, retiring for the night in comfort and peace.<br>
<br>
But I still dream about the clay.<br>
