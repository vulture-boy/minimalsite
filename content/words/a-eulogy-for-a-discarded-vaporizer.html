          <strong>a eulogy for a discarded vaporizer</strong><br>
          <hr>

          i saw a vaporizer pen in distress in the middle of the neighbourhood road<br>
          its ignition light blinked LED white for one last hurrah, then extinguished<br>
          the basin of its vessel had long been crushed by a passing vehicle<br>
          <br>
          i regret to inform the audience that I left it for dead<br>
          i gave it a glance and thought, for the faintest of moments<br>
          maybe it needs help<br>
          maybe i ought to kick it to the curb of the road<br>
          call for help<br> 
          inform its guardian of its fate <br>
          halfway across the street, I gave it one last look<br>
          its ignition light staring me directly in the eye, blinking one last time<br>
          <br>
          it must be dead by now. surely.<br>
          with that much damage it could not logically vape a resin again<br>
          that poor sod<br>
          it's a vaporizer. relax! who cares what happened to it?<br>
          leave the ol' bruiser alone<br>
          if they really cared for it they wouldn't have left it on the street<br>
          let's just get home<br>
          it's nice and warm at home <br>
          <br>
          ah fuck<br>
          <br>
          i stepped back out into the darkness<br>
          the rain spat a damp mist<br>
          carefully i scraped its remains into a clean dish towel, wiped the soot off and carried it home. <br>
          once i got in, i rested it on my tea-stained kitchen countertop and warmed it under the space heater<br>
          i immediately called the authorities<br>
          hogging the line?<br>
          this vaporizer needs help!<br>
          the electronic device looked at me with pleading eyes<br>
          but i could tell<br>
          they were merely white<br>
          with death<br>
          <br>
          the following morning i missed my meeting to give it a proper burial in the yard<br>
          maybe it can live a second life as world-building inspiration for the next Pikmin game, i thought <br>
          i wiped the crust from my eyes <br>
          such a poor piece of technology<br>
          am i holding it back from landfill valhalla?<br>
          am i dismissing its chances of joining the collective trash consciousness of the pacific trash island?<br>
          surely this is its fate<br>
          surely the soil<br>
          <br>
          ------<br>
          <br>
          ah, one last update. it's been two weeks.<br> 
          the neighbours were out in the garden planting tomatoes<br>
          perhaps that's its destiny. a tomato.<br>
          just another vessel waiting to be crushed... wonderful<br>
          <br>
