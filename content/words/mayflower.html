          <strong>Midnight Mayflower</strong><br>
          <hr>
          
          <p>
            tablespoons of melting butter, bubbling over the sides upon bowls of popcorn<br>
i dress my evening's savoury 'dessert' in front of an 1920's art deco liquor cabinet. emptied of stock, its mirrored panelled display make iconic of a layman's meal.<br>
the opening sequence of a late 90's anime splashes the CRT screen above the refridgerator. fireworks outside light in red, white and blue that, somehow, resemble popsicle treats moving at a monolithicly slow pace <br>
<br>
hazy memories merging as not-memories, and the strange dreams of a child processing nightmares through the tribulations of their parents divorce. I lay in bed as I scribe my stream of conscious and dwell upon the meaning, if there is one. More, surprised to find one. Late nights past midnight, ceiling-gazing to wistful bedroom dreampop -- the cauldron for twilight dreams in some sort of liminal limbo space even Chubby Checker can't circumnavigate, up from down. <br>
<br>
she's not home tonight. she'll be back, but for now its alone with my thoughts and the trials of self-regulation. Its surprisingly peaceful on the moon sometimes, feeling a little lighter in the air but not quite grounded. Or maybe I'm floating beneath a clear night sky by a beach, yearning to ride some inflatable crawdad like the ones we used to joust with in the summer pool as kids. I'm just in my bedroom, but as I progressively grow tired it seems more like the liminal space between dreamy destinations the brochures don't even tell you about. <br>
<br>
When I'm unconscious, does my unawareness move between these dream spaces, 'physically' present but consciously dormant? Not to confuse metaphors, but when we sleep on the train across a country, we still visit the places we pass through, the circulated air still drawn into our lungs and becoming part of us. If a child scrawled a masque over my face while I dreamt, I'd have a tangible souvenir. So then, are these dream phenomenon brushing across my mind as I sleep leaving their own masque? The tears I draw from a nightmare are very much on my face when I escape the terrors. <br>
<br>
I pause, take a breath. Another metaphysical pondering. I need to rest, put down the phone. I have real friends to look forward to, a vibrant neighbourhood to stroll, financial obligations to manage. Somehow the air feels fresher in the room, the worlds cast upon the stone plate. Intellectuals talk about dreams as a pondering mechanism of the brain to help solve its dilemmas. I feel thats what journaling is in this context. And now I begin to doubt that sleep and dreams are as 'unconscious' as we might believe them to be. <br>
<br>
Good night. Sweet dreams. May we be at peace with our possibilities and live our best reality. May our Mayflower reach safe harbour and embrace unity with its shores.<br>
