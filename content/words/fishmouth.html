          <strong>fish-mouth</strong><br>
          <hr>
          
            <p>
            
            My mouth is full of large, squirming fish, eyes searching<br>
            My voice reverberates and cuts between their fishscales<br>
            Gasping, gagging, a swallowing stream<br>
            The anxiety builds as I try to speak, as I try not to choke, which only serves to further agitate the piscine between my teeth and my throat<br>
Conditioned to accept the fallacy that the fish can only survive in a basin of water while the lake remains so far away<br>
Sometimes I tell others about the fish, but my live experience and theirs couldn't be further apart<br>
Wanting to be part of conversations but spitting gills with each phrase<br>
Harming others with each croaked rhyme<br>
I try not to colour my impressions by these conversations; my mouth is full of fish, after all<br>
My stories are long, hard of breath, and deaf to those listening.<br>
The fish are an uncomfortable percept, that discomfort is to be expected in my company.<br>
<br>
Fish must breathe too; they occupy the air I breathe and the brainstem receives what's left.<br>
Sometimes I speak to the fish, but the only words I hear are my own reflected back<br>
<br>
One day I met my wife. She was a fisher. She could hook their cheeks so casually and in the night we'd have supper. <br>
These days were filled with joy, and she understood me for who I was, as not only was my mouth occupied, <br>
but she was also familiar and compassionate about my condition. <br>
Sometimes new fish would swim back up from my lungs, but with her help we turned this curse into a boon. <br>
Naturally, she means the world to me and I could scarcely live without her.<br>
<br>
But even in this brief absence, I find myself afflicted again.<br>
A fisher must be with the sea, of course. The fish are keeping me up at night, my gag reflex is on edge. <br>
I'm not sleeping quite as comfortably, would you?<br>
I don't know how much of this is brought upon myself for stoking the ire of the hexer; <br>
sometimes one's errors lack equivalency to the punishment due. The burden is mine to accept and carry. <br>
I must be by the ocean, and I must also cure myself of this affliction. <br>
For not all of my friends are fishers and they shouldn't need to ply trade to know me the way I wish to be known.<br>
I want to become the fisher. Let me discover balance in my catch and keep. <br>
Leave the mongering to the mongers and keep my lips sealed, the airways clear.<br>
Let me feel a careless ocean breeze and breathe its whisps freely,<br>
When my mouth is no longer full of fish.<br>
